# PhD course
   
This is a yearly event where we move in one week from the physics of light through the composition of the microscope, fluorescence microscopy and end up with some image analysis. All the lectures are followed by practicals to really put your obtained knowledge into practice.

## Topics
- Physics of light   
    - [Starting with how light is created and which properties of light play a role in microscopy](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_dcxitmkj)
- Microscope components   
- Kohler illumination   
    - [The second step in the course is to know which components are in the microscope and how to set them up optimally](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_e38wkqm7)
- Histology and sample preparation   
    - [In the 3rd lecture we move the focus to preparing our samples optimally and as simple as possible](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_691gnymw)
- Phase contrast   
- DIC   
- Dark field   
    - [In the this lecture contrast enhancing techniques are discussed and how they work to improve your images, but also how to set it up properly within the microscope](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_49ht4u6e)   
- Fluorescence microscopy   
- Confocal microscopy   
- Advanced fluorescence microscopy   
    - [Moving from brightfield to fluorescence to show what fluorescence is capable off and how to apply it optimally](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_9lonufca)
 - OMERO
    - Once we have obtained our images we need to store them in a FAIR manner, here we show the way to do this and the benefits of doing so
- Image analysis   
- Automated image analysis   
    - [On the last day of the course we focus on what we can do with the obtained images to extract quantifiable data. In the morning we learn how to do this manually in FIJI, in the afternoon we move to automated measurements, and recording of macros.](https://video.leidenuniv.nl/media/t/1_ye02kigs)
