# CellProfiler  
Getting started with CellProfiler: [Tutorials](https://cellprofiler.org/tutorials)  
  
## Installation  
You can get the lastest version of CellProfiler [here](https://cellprofiler.org/releases)  . Be aware that in some cases pipelines will only work with a specific version of CellProfiler so you can download specific versions [here](https://cellprofiler.org/previous-releases).
  
## CellProfiler with AI tools included:  
Getting CellProfiler to work with AI tools for segmentation can be challenging. Some people have made a release of CellProfiler with Stardist and [Cellpose](cellpose.md) included. When you install this version on your computer it should work with these tools directly.  
  
You can find the .exe file on [Github](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/CellProfiler/releases/v4.2.80002-ai/)
