# Setting up conda for Python

## Installation
To be able to handle multiple Python software environments on a system use of conda is advised. Different software packages require different versions of Python and other dependencies. Conda allows to create isolated environments on your computer.
It is recommended to always work within an conda environment and not in the **base** environment.

A detailed instruction how to setup conda can be found here.
