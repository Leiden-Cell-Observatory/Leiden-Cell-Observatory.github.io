# High-Performance Computing (Alice)

This section covers the usage of the Alice HPC cluster for image analysis.

## Overview

The Alice cluster provides high-performance computing capabilities for more demanding image analysis tasks.

More on Alice: [Alice Wiki](https://pubappslu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HPCWIKI/pages/37519361/ALICE)

With Alice it is possible to connect to a desktop environment to run GUI applications like QuPath or [Cellpose](../analysis/cellpose.md).   
Furthermore it is possible to run containers via singularity or apptainer, this allows to run analysis tools in a contained environment.
Some examples of container definitions for image analysis tools can be found here:

## Alternatives
At LUMC there is [SHARK](https://pubappslu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HPCWIKI/pages/37519859/Getting+an+account+on+SHARK) 

Furthermore SURF provides a national HPC with [Snellius](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/spaces/WIKI/pages/30660190/Obtaining+an+account+on+Snellius)
