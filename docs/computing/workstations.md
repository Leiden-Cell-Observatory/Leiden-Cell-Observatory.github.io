# Image Analysis Workstations

In case your image analysis requires more computing resources for example a dedicated GPU for AI-based image processing, we might be able to help.   
At the Cell Observatory several image analysis workstations are available with dedicated GPUs. 
Please reach out to the people of the Cell Observatory for advice.
