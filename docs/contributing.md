This wiki is for all of us, so if you think something is missing, feel free to contribute!

For people at Leiden University you can join the Cell Observatory Github organization. Reach out to @maartenpaul or m.w.paul@lacdr.leidenuniv.nl, to get direct access to contribute to the wiki directly. 

Or if you prefer can you post your contribution on the Cell Observatory MS Teams website and it will be added here :smile:.
