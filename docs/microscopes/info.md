# General Information


## Training
Due to the level of advanced knowledge needed to operate the microscopes in the Cell observatory safely and correctly training is needed. Please contact the [facility staff](https://leiden-cell-observatory.github.io/contact/) for training options. Or consider joining the yearly [PhD course on microscopy](../courses/phd-course.md).

## Fees
For usage of equipment there can be a charge for the maintenance and operating costs. Please contact the [facility staff](https://leiden-cell-observatory.github.io/contact/) to know which charges apply.

## LUMC Light Microscopy Facility
Microscopes at LUMC are also available for university employees, but usage is charged via an hour tariff. For questions you can reach out to `lightmicroscopy@lumc.nl`.
Here you can find an [overview of microscopes and filters](https://ccb.lumc.nl/upload/files/overzicht_microscopen_filtercubes_updateJul2025_web.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

## Choosing a Microscope

Consider these factors when selecting a microscope:

- Sample type and preparation
- Required resolution
- Fluorescence vs. transmitted light
- Live-cell imaging requirements
- Speed requirements
- Sample sensitivity

Please contact the [facility staff](https://leiden-cell-observatory.github.io/contact/) for guidance on selecting the most appropriate system for your experiments.
