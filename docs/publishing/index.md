# Publishing

This section provides guidelines and resources for publishing your microscopy data and analysis.

## Publishing Guidelines
- [Data Repositories](sharing_data.md) - Information on where to publish your microscopy data
- [Writing Methods](methods.md) - Templates and guidelines for writing microscopy methods sections
- [Citing](citing.md) - How to properly cite microscopy equipment and software

## Best Practices

### Data Presentation
- Include scale bars in all microscopy images
- Clearly state any image processing steps
- Provide relevant imaging parameters
- Use consistent display settings within figure panels

### Data Availability
- Consider depositing raw data in public [repositories](sharing_data.md)
- Include analysis scripts and workflows
- Document software versions and parameters
- Link to protocols and detailed methods

### Reproducibility
- Document all image acquisition parameters
- Provide detailed analysis workflows
- Include statistical methods and sample sizes
- Share code via GitHub or similar platforms
