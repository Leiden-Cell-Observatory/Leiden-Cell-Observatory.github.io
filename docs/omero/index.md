# OMERO

OMERO (Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects) is the primary platform for microscopy data management, storage, and sharing at Leiden University. Almost all microscopes are connected to OMERO for data storage. This wiki provides an overview of OMERO features and best practices for working with microscopy data. By maintaining your image data in an organized way in OMERO, you can easily access and share your data. The possibilities of OMERO to organize the experimental and imaging metadata will increase the FAIRness of your data.
