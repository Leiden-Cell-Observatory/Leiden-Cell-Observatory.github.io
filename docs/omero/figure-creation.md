# OMERO.figure

A very helpful feature of OMERO is the ability to generate figure panels of your images directly from the web interface. It is possible to:   
- add labels to the images in your figure, based on the metadata stored in OMERO.
- add scale bars, and assure consistent image display settings across all images in your figure.
- export figures as high-quality PNG or PDF files. It is possible to include the original images and a reference to the image data in OMERO.

## Directly exporting a figure from OMERO.web
Apart from OMERO.figure, you can also create simple figures directly from the OMERO.web interface. This is a quick way to generate figures of your images or wells.

1)  Select the dataset or plate where you are interested in and click on one or multiple wells or images images.

2)  Click on the publication options button (figure 1).

3)  Now you will get three options: Split View figure (1), Thumbnail figure (2) and Make Movie (3, only when you have time series). The split view figure will create a split view (figure 2) of the selected well(s), the thumbnail will create an small image (or set of images of your plate) and the movie makes a movie.

4)  Choose the option you would like and follow the steps in the menu. Once the figure/movie is ready, you can download it or show it in the browser by clicking on the \[Activities\] button and choose one of the options.
