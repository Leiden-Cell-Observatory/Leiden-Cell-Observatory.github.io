# Metadata Annotations

This guide covers how to add and manage metadata annotations in OMERO.

## Types of Metadata

OMERO supports several types of metadata annotations:
- Tags
- Key-value pairs
- Comments
- Files
- Ratings

## Adding Metadata template to OMERO
### Attaching a description, metadata and quantified results to your images

To make the data FAIR, you will have to attach metadata to your images. Items to add are the metadata template (mandatory), library files (if applicable) and the plate layouts. At the right side of the screen you can add those items.

1)  Give your plate a short, descriptive description by clicking on the pencil icon (figure 11, red box). It is optional to add some tags as well. This might help to retrieve the data more easy later on.

2)  Add the (mandatory) attachments to the file using the attachment section (figure 11, green box). This includes the metadata template in pdf format and all additional files.

### Basic Annotations
1. **Tags**
   - Use consistent naming
   - Create tag sets for organization
   - Apply multiple tags as needed

2. **Key-Value Pairs**
   - Experimental conditions
   - Instrument settings
   - Sample information

3. **Comments**
   - Observation notes
   - Quality assessments
   - Processing steps

### Advanced Metadata

#### File Annotations
- Attach protocols
- Include analysis scripts
- Link to supplementary data

#### Structured Annotations
- Create custom forms
- Define metadata templates
- Use consistent formats

## Best Practices

### Organization
1. **Tag Management**
   - Use hierarchical tag sets
   - Maintain consistent naming
   - Document tag meanings

2. **Key-Value Structure**
   - Use standard formats
   - Define required fields
   - Document units

### Workflow Integration
1. **During Import**
   - Add essential metadata
   - Apply standard tags
   - Include basic annotations

2. **Post-Import**
   - Add analysis results
   - Update with findings
   - Link related data
