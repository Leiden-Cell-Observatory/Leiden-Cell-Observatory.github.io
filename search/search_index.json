This file list supports URLs including OMERO URLs. You can drag URLs from a text document and drop them into the file list. The URLs do not end with image file extensions (like .TIF), so you need to change the \"Filter images?\" setting to \"No filtering\" to allow the OMERO URLs to be processed further. You should be able to view the image by double-clicking on it and you should be able to extract plate, well, site and channel name metadata from each image using the \"Extract from image file headers\" method in the Metadata module (press the \"Update Metadata\" button after selecting the \"Extract from image file headers\" method). If your experiment has more than one image channel, you can use the \"ChannelName\" metadata extracted from the OMERO image to create image sets containing all of your image channels. In the NamesAndTypes module, change the \"Assign a name to\" setting to \"Images matching rules\". For the rule criteria, select \"Metadata does have ChannelName matching\" and enter the name that appears under \"Channels\" in the OMERO Insight browser. Add additional channels to NamesAndTypes using the \"Add another image\" button.</p> <p>Limitations: - It won't work well for 3D images.
