# A1 User Manual

## Overview

The A1 is a fluorescence microscope that uses LED lights for fluorophore excitation instead of a traditional white light source. This unique feature provides precise control over excitation wavelengths and reduces photobleaching.

## LED Illumination System

### Excitation Control
- The LED lights can be turned on/off using the control wheel on the right side of the microscope
- Brightness can be adjusted by moving the wheel up (more intense) or down (less intense)
- Press the wheel to toggle the fluorescence on/off

### Filter Positions
The filter wheel has multiple positions for different fluorescence channels:

1. Position 1: Brightfield
2. Position 2: Green fluorescence
3. Position 3: Red fluorescence
4. Position 4: Blue fluorescence

## Brightfield Imaging

### Condenser Settings
Located below the stage, the condenser wheel offers several imaging modes:

- **Phase Contrast Settings**:
  - Ph1: For 10x magnification
  - Ph2: For 20x and 40x magnification
  - Ph3: For 100x magnification
- **D**: Darkfield imaging mode

### Light Control
- Power switch: Located on the left side behind the focus wheel
- Intensity adjustment: Use the wheel below the focus wheel on the left side

### Transmitted Light Blocking
When combining brightfield with fluorescence imaging:
1. Locate the black bar block
2. Remove and invert it so the black bar blocks the transmitted light
3. The diffuser end will stick out when properly positioned

## Image Acquisition

Once your sample is in focus and imaging parameters are set, proceed to image acquisition using the computer system.

> For optimal results when combining fluorescence and brightfield imaging, ensure proper blocking of transmitted light to prevent interference with fluorescence signals.

## Best Practices

1. Start with lower LED intensities and adjust as needed
2. Verify correct phase contrast settings for your objective
3. Ensure proper light blocking when combining imaging modes
4. Focus your sample using brightfield before switching to fluorescence
